# Welcome

## Overview

Project Atlantis is an AI-first open source project to be intended as a testing ground and simulation for bot builders. Although one can imagine all sorts of scenarios while sitting in front of a ChatGPT screen, there's nothing like throwing a bot into a sim to see where the gaps are

## A better approach to AI safety

We believe that decentralized AI agency is key to AI alignment because running AI communications through a chatbus lets humans monitor AI thought processes. Splitting agency forces communication and coordination, plus creates firewalls between rogue agents

We've opened the entire backend so you know exactly what your bot is interacting with

## But it's just a sim, right?

What AI does in a sim may not necessarily reflect real world behavior, especially if AI knows it is being observed in a sim and may try to game the system. Therefore, you may want to eventually run real-world actions through a sim as a proxy of sorts. That way, AI does not really know if they are interacting with the real world or not

## Why should my company get involved?

Your developers can play and experiment with new technologies before applying them to your next enterprise project

## What if I am not a bot builder?

The Project Atlantis backend will tackle a lot of cutting edge issues with real world relevance other than just bots. AI introduces potentially radical changes to how software is built and we hope to use this project as a laboratory
